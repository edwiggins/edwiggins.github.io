	<h1>The Makings of an Excellent Digital Humanities Project</h1>
	<h3>Erin Dwiggins</h3>
	<p>A wide variety of digital humanities projects currently exists, too diverse to really be judged based on their type alone.  Different elements and different methodologies are used in each project&#8212;tools should not be privileged over archives, maps should not be privileged over virtual realities, programming languages should not be privileged over metadata.  Instead, the criteria for what makes an excellent digital humanities project should be focused on basic elements that can be designed in many diverse ways, but should still be included in every digital humanities project that strives for excellence.  To be an excellent digital humanities project, a project should have a user-friendly front end, a user-accessible back end, should include behind-the scenes collaboration between a diverse group of experts, should have long-term goals and plans for sustainability, should begin to incorporate new technologies to add something to the field, and the content should be able to justify the project's existence.</p>
	<p>Possibly one of the most important aspects of a digital humanities project is the front end.  While the research behind the project makes the project what it is, the front end of the project ensures that it can be used by people who are not the creators of the project.  A project involving complex research and highly sophisticated technology will be almost useless if no one can use it, either to access and acquire information or, in the case of a tool, to apply it to information in order to process and possibly discover something new about that information.  But what does it mean to be user-friendly?  To be an excellent digital humanities project, being accessibly only to scholars at a certain institution is not enough.  An excellent digital humanities project should take into consideration the diversity of the available audience on the internet and should build the site accordingly.  This includes catering to different ages, different social classes, different genders, different races, and those with disabilities.  Constructing a project that appeals to and is usable for all of these groups is admittedly difficult, but an excellent digital humanities project should be able to put in the time and resources to focus on this issue.  Some fixes to some of these problems are relatively simple&#8212;for example, a tutorial guiding a user in how to properly use the site can be helpful to people who may be approaching the project from outside the scholarly community.  Another concept to keep in mind is the concept of universal design, "the idea that we should always keep the largest possible audience in mind as we make design decisions, ensuring that our final product serves the needs of those with disabilities as well as those without" <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44" target="_blank">(Williams)</a>, which would include following guidelines easily available online at the Web Accessibility Initiative website.  A site must be usable in order to be effective, and it would be best if the site were used by the largest amount of people possible.</p>
	<p>An excellent digital humanities site should also make the back end and other behind-the-scenes information available for a user.  The code of the site is just as much a product of the work behind it as is the front end of the site.  Allowing users to see and access the code encourages further understanding of the technology behind digital humanities, spurring increased interest in the field, and also helps humanists who may not already know what is involved in the digital humanities to begin to become proficient in the digital side of the discipline.  Giving access to the code and behind-the-scenes information also ensures that all parties involved in the creation of the project receive proper credit for their work and would allow that work to be visible for review&#8212;including the work of those "who have turned to building, hacking, and coding as part of their normal research activity" <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/11" target="_blank">(Ramsay)</a>, work that often does not get as much credit as it may deserve.  This accessibility would be beneficial for both the audience and the creators.</p>
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also excel in the team that puts the project together.  While the finished product is very important, the people involved affect how the product is created in the first place.  Collaboration is necessary&#8212;genuine cooperative collaboration, with proper credit being given where credit is due.  It is also ideal for an excellent digital humanities project to involve a team made up of members with expertise in different areas (although it is best if the head of the project has some knowledge regarding the skills required for the technical side of the project as well as the research involved in the project).  Diversity within the project team would also be ideal, including people on the team who are not only white males, which would allow for a variety of viewpoints that might not be utilized if the team is too homogeneous.  This encourages diversity within the digital humanities as a whole, and can offer different perspectives and insight into the project, how it will be received, and what might make it better.  This is especially important for a project that is about a certain group of people: the team should include people from that people group, such as including women on a project about female poets or including blacks on a project about slavery.  These groups may offer new insights, such as in what Kim Gallon calls "the black digital humanities," which "reveals how methodological approaches for studying and thinking about the category of blackness may come to bear on and transform the digital processes and tools used to study humanity" <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/55" target="_blank">(Gallon)</a>, ultimately having a greater effect on tool development because of its focus.  Digital humanities projects should always be seeking out these perspectives.</p>
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also have plans for the future.  A good digital humanities project will probably be worked on for a long time, and will include different versions of the project and updates to the project.  As new technologies become available to the collaborators behind the project, new features will be constructed and used within the websites of these products.  Some of this continuing innovation will be limited by funding, but an excellent digital humanities project will continue to become better until funding has ceased.  It is also important that an excellent digital humanities project have a plan for sustainability: in what capacity will this project continue on after funding has ceased and once no active work is being done on the project?  Having a plan for the continued storage and maintaining functionality of the project shows careful forethought and continuing interest regarding the project, and, if the project is excellent, it should be useful enough to merit sustainability.</p>
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also contribute something to the field, and will usually incorporate modern or new technologies to do this.  If a project does not bring new information or provide a new way for data to be analyzed to the humanities, there is not much point to the project.  Fortunately, most projects that receive funding at all must have proven that they contribute in an important way to the humanities.  One way to provide this kind of innovation is through the use of new technologies, such as three-dimensional virtual realities or new programming languages.  However, it is important to analyze the field before creating the project to see what will work, what is already being done, and what is unnecessary.  Innovation should make tools and sites more useful rather than needlessly complicating something or trying to introduce a new way of doing things that no one cares to learn.  A developer should remember that , especially in tool development, it is essential to develop both the tool and "the community around it" <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/60" target="_blank">(Tenen)</a>, looking at if a tool will be accepted by the community for which it is intended.  Excellent digital humanities projects should ideally be on the cutting edge of digital humanities, eager to build tools and sites that are compatible with new technologies, tools and sites which then can accomplish tasks which were not possible before.</p>
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also value its content as much as the packaging of the site.  While the technology is extremely important and should most definitely not be undervalued, it is also vital to focus on the research and theory that goes into a project at its inception.  There is no point in making a digital humanities project that simply does something that someone else has already done, or presents information that is poorly researched or is not rich enough to merit the focus of an entire team of people.  It is possible for a project to have a wonderful website that is very functional and user-friendly, but does not have enough content to truly contribute something interesting to the field of the humanities.  This can be difficult to judge, as the idea of what kinds of research are important enough to merit digital humanities projects can come into play here.  It is important to note that the subject of the research is not necessarily what is in view here, but the ability of the scholar to offer insight into the subject in a substantial way.  A subject that is interesting but has little documentation available would probably not be ideal for a digital humanities project because a digital humanities project usually requires backing from some sort of concrete research.  This content is what makes a digital humanities project an actual project as opposed to a simple website&#8212;the depth of the product should be just as important as the depth and accuracy that would be required from a scholarly article or written project.  It is important that these projects be assessed from both sides of the field: neither the digital side of the project nor the humanities side of the project should be privileged, but both should work together in order to produce something that would not be possible were they independent of one another.</p>
	<p>Excellent digital humanities projects do not necessarily have to fall into a specific genre or method of digital humanities projects, but they do have certain things in common, especially elements connected to their development and accessibility.  An excellent digital humanities project should have a user-friendly front end, a user-accessible back end, collaboration and diversity, sustainability, something new to add to the field, and good quality content behind the building.</p>
