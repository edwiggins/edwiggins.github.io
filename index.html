	<h1>The Makings of an Excellent Digital Humanities Project</h1>
	<h3>Erin Dwiggins</h3>
	<p>A wide variety of digital humanities projects currently exists, too diverse to really be judged based on their type alone.  Different elements and different methodologies are used in each project&#8212;tools should not be privileged over archives, maps should not be privileged over virtual realities, programming languages should not be privileged over metadata.  Instead, the criteria for what makes an excellent digital humanities project should be focused on basic elements that can be designed in many d...(line truncated)...
	<p>Possibly one of the most important aspects of a digital humanities project is the front end.  While the research behind the project makes the project what it is, the front end of the project ensures that it can be used by people who are not the creators of the project.  A project involving complex research and highly sophisticated technology will be almost useless if no one can use it, either to access and acquire information or, in the case of a tool, to apply it to information in order to process and ...(line truncated)...
	<p>An excellent digital humanities site should also make the back end and other behind-the-scenes information available for a user.  The code of the site is just as much a product of the work behind it as is the front end of the site.  Allowing users to see and access the code encourages further understanding of the technology behind digital humanities, spurring increased interest in the field, and also helps humanists who may not already know what is involved in the digital humanities to begin to become p...(line truncated)...
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also excel in the team that puts the project together.  While the finished product is very important, the people involved affect how the product is created in the first place.  Collaboration is necessary&#8212;genuine cooperative collaboration, with proper credit being given where credit is due.  It is also ideal for an excellent digital humanities project to involve a team made up of members with expertise in different areas (although it is best if the hea...(line truncated)...
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also have plans for the future.  A good digital humanities project will probably be worked on for a long time, and will include different versions of the project and updates to the project.  As new technologies become available to the collaborators behind the project, new features will be constructed and used within the websites of these products.  Some of this continuing innovation will be limited by funding, but an excellent digital humanities project wil...(line truncated)...
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also contribute something to the field, and will usually incorporate modern or new technologies to do this.  If a project does not bring new information or provide a new way for data to be analyzed to the humanities, there is not much point to the project.  Fortunately, most projects that receive funding at all must have proven that they contribute in an important way to the humanities.  One way to provide this kind of innovation is through the use of new t...(line truncated)...
	<p>An excellent digital humanities project should also value its content as much as the packaging of the site.  While the technology is extremely important and should most definitely not be undervalued, it is also vital to focus on the research and theory that goes into a project at its inception.  There is no point in making a digital humanities project that simply does something that someone else has already done, or presents information that is poorly researched or is not rich enough to merit the focus ...(line truncated)...
	<p>Excellent digital humanities projects do not necessarily have to fall into a specific genre or method of digital humanities projects, but they do have certain things in common, especially elements connected to their development and accessibility.  An excellent digital humanities project should have a user-friendly front end, a user-accessible back end, collaboration and diversity, sustainability, something new to add to the field, and good quality content behind the building.</p>
